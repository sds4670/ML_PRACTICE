# ML_PRACTICE
This repository contains my structured Machine Learning practice while pursuing my MSc in Data Science.

The goal of this repo is **not random experimentation**, but to build strong fundamentals, clear implementations, and reusable references for ML concepts that matter in real-world projects and interviews.
